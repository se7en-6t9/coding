## Am I using GitHub Pro?

To confirm whether your account is on GitHub Pro:

1. Sign in and go to **Settings → Billing & plans** (or visit https://github.com/settings/billing/plans).
2. Under **Current plan**, look for **GitHub Pro**. If you see a different plan name (e.g., Free), you are not using Pro.
3. If you had Pro via a trial or Student Developer Pack, the plan name will indicate whether that access is still active.
